Older, thicker Arctic sea ice declines
September 1984 - September 2016

The area covered by Arctic sea ice at least four years old has decreased from 718,000 square miles (1,860,000 square kilometers) in September 1984 to 42,000 square miles (110,000 square kilometers) in September 2016. Ice that has built up over the years tends to be thicker and less vulnerable to melting away than newer ice. In these visualizations of data from buoys, weather stations, satellites and computer models, the age of the ice is indicated by shades ranging from blue-gray for the youngest ice to white for the oldest.


Three Gorges Dam brings power, concerns to central China
September 24, 1993 - August 22, 2016

China’s Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River became the world’s largest hydroelectric power plant upon its completion in 2012. It has also eased flooding and river navigation and provided water for irrigation. However, construction forced some 1.2 million people to relocate and, according to a 2010 study, triggered about 3,400 earthquakes and numerous landslides from mid-2003 through 2009. Changes in river flow have raised concerns about silt accumulation and biodiversity loss. Important archeological sites and ancient monuments were reportedly inundated as the reservoir filled. Forested areas appear red in these images to represent measurements by infrared sensors.


Neumayer Glacier shrinks on South Georgia Island
January 11, 2005 - September 14, 2016

Neumayer Glacier is on the east coast of South Georgia, an island some 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers) east of South America’s southern tip. It has retreated more than 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) during the past 16 years. Neumayer flows into the ocean; even a tiny change in ocean temperature significantly affects the amount of heat available to melt the glacier.


Urban expansion in Shanghai, China
April 23, 1984 - July 20, 2016

Shanghai epitomizes China’s urbanization trend over the last four decades. Its population doubled from 12 million in 1982 to 24 million in 2016. Analysis of satellite imagery found that the city’s area ballooned from 119 square miles (308 square kilometers) in 1984 to 503 square miles (1,302 square kilometers) in 2014. As concrete replaced forests and farmland during that period, creating an urban heat island effect, Shanghai saw an 81 percent increase in area affected by higher temperatures. In these images, developed areas appear gray and white; farmland and forests are green; shallow, sediment-filled water is tan.


California’s wildflower superbloom
March 25, 2016 - March 28, 2017

After five years of drought, California finally got relief during the winter of 2016-2017 with much-needed precipitation. As a result, brilliant shades of yellow and green bejeweled southern California. These natural color images show the difference in vegetation from March 2016 to March 2017, with an especially brilliant display in the latter image just south of the Cuyama River on the slopes of the Sierra Madre Mountains.


Heavy rains flood Peru
March 24, 2016 - March 23, 2017

Heavy rains that began in mid-March 2017 have devastated much of Peru. According to reports, more than 70,000 people lost their homes and more than 60 people died in floods and mudslides. Both the Lago La Niña and Piura River have overflowed their banks. Official data report that about 4,660 miles (7,500 km) of roads and 509 bridges have been damaged. In these false-color images, clouds and salt pans (depressions in the ground in which salt water evaporates, leaving salt behind) appear light blue.


Ethiopian volcano Erta Ale erupts
January 10, 2017 - February 11, 2017

In early 2017, the Landsat 8 satellite captured volcanic activity at northern Ethiopia’s Erta Ale, a shield volcano near the Eritrea border. Translated into “smoking mountain” with a vent called “the gateway to hell,” Erta Ale oozed a lava lake on Jan. 10 (left) that outgassed on Feb. 11 (right). Landsat also detected other hot spots on the southeastern slope of the volcano, as shown in the Feb. 11 image. The satellite’s shortwave infrared (SWIR) signal infers increased temperatures where new lava is either at very shallow depths below the surface or gurgling to the surface.


Oil well fire in Iraq
June 18, 2014 - Sept. 29, 2017

These images show the Hamrin Mountains in northern Iraq before and during an oil well fire. To the left of the thick, dark smoke in the 2017 image, an oil spill is visible flowing over valley agricultural land for about 7 miles (11 kilometers).
